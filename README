Alien-Charles

From http://www.charlesproxy.com/

    Charles is an HTTP proxy / HTTP monitor / Reverse Proxy that
    enables a developer to view all of the HTTP traffic between their
    machine and the Internet. This includes requests, responses and
    the HTTP headers (which contain the cookies and caching
    information).

Charles is a shareware application developed by Karl von Randow at
XK72 Ltd.

Charles also has a Firefox plug-in available. This Firefox plug-in
allows Charles to automatically take over Firefox's proxy settings
whilst it is running, and restores them when Charles exits (or the
user decides to stop proxying through Charles).

This Perl module uses this feature to allow Perl programs to also
automatically proxy through Charles by mimicing the behaviour of the
Firefox plug-in.
